this is a french language practice application .  the main files are in the parent folder "French".  can you identify any inconsistencies in the main html files? specifically I want consistent use of the CEFR and the tooltips (the language shown on the webpage should be French and the tooltips should be English).  I want the tooltips to be excluded from the read aloud. Also I want consistent use of the style.css (no style code in the individual html files).
